"body": "\u201cThe Barefoot Boy with Boots On\u201d is one of many wild and woolly songs composed by the late Asa Martin of Irvine, Ky. Asa was, for much of his early career, a talent scout for several east Kentucky radio stations...back when live broadcasts were the rule rather than the exception. His inventive guitar style made him much in demand for recordings (he recorded extensively with Doc Roberts) and for fiddling contests. Probably Asa's most well known songs is \u201cHot Corn, Cold Corn,\u201d the very first surrealistic bluegrass song, recorded by Flatt and Scruggs. Asa died in his garden last August, ending a life of great vitality and music.<br><br>The tune I use here is not Asa's but rather \u201cThe Death of Floyd Collins,\u201d as inspired by Tracy Schwarz. The last verse is lifted from \u201cThe Dying Fishermsn's Lament\u201d or \u201cThe Raving of Sir Rupt.\u201d Take your pick.<br><br>Oh, the night was dark and cloudy<br>The moon was shining bright<br>The stars were casting burning rays<br>On the storm that raged that night<br>Lightening struck the cowshed<br>And the cows all chewed their cud<br>Moonlight set the prairie on fire<br>In the middle of the woods<br><br>Oh, the barefoot boy with boots on<br>Come a-shuffling down the street<br>His pants were full of pockets<br>And his boots were full of feet<br>He was born when he was a baby<br>His grandma's pride and joy<br>His only sister was a girl<br>And his brother was a boy<br><br>He never was a triplet<br>But he always was a twin<br>His legs were fastened to his knees<br>Just below his chin<br>And his feet were fastened to his ankles<br>Several inches from his shoulder<br>And when he grew up he became a man<br>And everyday got older<br><br>He married him a woman<br>Who quickly became his wife<br>For you see he could not marry her<br>And maintain a single life<br>Her head was full of notions<br>And her mouth was full of tongue<br>They raised a dozen children<br>All born when they was young<br><br>Six boys, five girls<br>And then another child<br>They never tried to raise them right<br>Just let them grow up wild<br>And late in the evening<br>They'd send them off to bed<br>Not sure if they was living<br>And they wished they all was dead<br><br>The youngest was a baby<br>But the oldest was one first<br>The good one was the bad one<br>But the bad one was the worst<br>They never knew their ages<br>No, they never seemed to care<br>\u2018Cause they knew they had a birthday<br>And it came \u2018round once a year<br><br>They never knew their father's age<br>But they always had a hunch<br>That he was born before their time<br>Was the oldest of the bunch<br>And when they died they could not speak<br>Their names they could not tell<br>The girls all went to heaven<br>And the boys all went to<br><br>The organ peeled potatoes<br>Lard was rendered by the choir<br>When the parson rang the dishrag<br>Someone set the church on fire<br>\u201cHole smokes!\u201d the preacher shouted<br>As he madly tour his hair<br>Now his head resembles heaven<br>For there'll be no parting there"

He and PeeWee Reese, a former wire splicer from western Kentucky, formed one of the great double play combos of the age. Robinson endured unimaginable taunting, threats, and dangers almost everywhere he played that year. Dodger owner, Branch Rickey, had obtained a promise from Robinson not to retaliate to such provocations. The Dodgers first series that season at Cincinnati's Crosley Field was met by a particularly antagonistic crowd. PeeWee, from just across the Ohio River, was a local favorite despite playing for the rival team. During the course of the game he'd simply had enough of the crowd's abuse of Robinson and called time. He walked over to Robinson, put is arm around Robinson's shoulder and casually talked to him.

She was born and raised in the Norton area, her father (the son of Irish immigrants) a foreman on the L&N railroad and her mother from a long line of singers native to the Wise County area. Her early years included playing in a string band with her brothers in 1914 and 1915 and from 1927-29 played with the Lonesome Pine Trailers, a popular local group that played intermittently on WOPI in Bristol and WEHC out of Emory and Henry College in Abingdon. Later years found Kate working in a WPA project organizing music programs and teaching guitar. From 1947 to 1954 Kate and Mrs. Meadie Moles broadcast on WNVA (Norton) as the Cumberland Valley Girls. The fifteen-minute program was aired twice weekly and included religious and sentimental songs, many of which Kate had written herself. Kate also teamed with \u201cWindy\u201d Wampler in the early fifties for a Sunday morning gospel program, also on WNVA.<br><br>Kate's songs, through her radio career, her frequent appearances and her generous sharing among friends and fellow musicians, are well known in many parts of southwest Virginia. Mountain Empire Community College in Big Stone Gap, Va. produced a limited edition album of Kate's music\u2014thanks to the efforts of George and Sherrod Reynolds and Roddy Moore. Since Kate's death in 1975, the album, along with a small songbook, are cherished remembrances of this strong, sensitive woman.</i><br><br>I found no rest for my soul<br>Till I heard that story told<br>Now I am in the shepherd's fold<br>And there's a deep settled peace in my soul<br><br>Chorus<br><br>There's a deep settled peace in my soul<br>I've been redeemed and made whole<br>I've been washed in the blood of the Lamb<br>And I know I understand<br>That deep settled peace in my soul<br><br>Let not your heart be troubled so<br>If to Jesus you will go<br>And in Him you'll learn to know<br>About the deep settled peace in your soul Chorus<br><br>And when death around you lies<br>And you must cross that great divide<br>If you have Jesus on your side<br>There'll be a deep settled peace in your soul Chorus"

Relative to Australia's population this was one of the largest demonstrations in world history. (It would be comparable to 5 million people demonstrating in the US.) Cathy Freeman, the Aboriginal Olympic champion, was one of the lead marchers.<br><br>Later, when Cathy Freeman lit the Olympic torch at the start of the 2000 Summer Games the symbolism of the two opposing, mutually existing elements of fire and water in the Opening Ceremony was not lost on those of us following the Reconciliation Movement. The day Freeman won the gold medal in the women's 400 meters a group of black and white Australian women were visiting my town. I was asked to join in welcoming them and composed this song in their honor. Kerrianne Cox was one of the women in that party and I asked her to join me on this recording.

But I was equally stunned by the \"leadership\" provided by the President and the Speaker of the House. They asked that we \"teach our children to resolve conflicts nonviolently\" and \"reject the culture of death\"...while overseeing the bombing of Yugoslavia.<br><br>We like our answers simple and clean in America. We're not a culture who easily summons the outrage to tackle difficult issues in complex and courageous ways. Call it the fault of Soundbite Politics, National Economic Numbness or Mass ADD...we're looking for single scapegoats: the parents, movies, violent video games, abortion, liberals...and that's only a small sampling of the newspaper commentaries I've read this week.<br><br>The truth, I believe, is a combination of many things. But this country is unique in really only one element of the puzzle. People in Europe and Canada, for instance, have equal access to the same movies, youth cults and video games we do. What they don't have is access to guns. In 1996 there were 16 handgun-related deaths in Japan, 30 in Great Britain, 106 in Canada...and 9,390 in the United States. Half of the deaths were children. That's 13 everyday. A Littleton, Colorado every single day.<br><br>Hunter and sportsmen don't need handguns. Neither does anyone else. You are 43 times more likely to be harmed by a firearm is you have one in your home than if you don't. When was the last time you heard of a drive-by knifing? I'm sorry, this is a no-brainer. If my kid is a pyromaniac I make sure there is no fuel and no match anywhere. But getting rid of handguns is not the sole solution. It's far more complicated than that. Blame whatever disconnect you want, as long as we prove to our children via our national policies that violence is the answer...whether it is in the battlefield or in the death chamber...we're never going to teach them otherwise. Teenagers, especially, have radar homed in to adult hypocrisy. And they see it everyday.<br><br>To quote my friend, Coleman McCarthy, \"We teach mathematics as though the survival of the species depends on it, yet where are the studies of nonviolence and peace?\" Our kids come home able to quote from memory the dates and players in all of our major wars but rarely learn about Gandhi, King, Tolstoy, Dorothy Day. Unless and until we start educating our children and ourselves...in the home and, yes, in the schools...about other ways to deal with differences and conflict our future will look darkly like our past. And the \"back to basics\" curriculum will continue to be Readin', 'Ritin', 'Rithmatic, and Retribution.<br><br>"

Seldom have I been in such a positive, supportive and family-friendly gathering as was on the Mall in Washington that day. The call for \u201csensible laws and safe kids\u201d resonated throughout the country as gatherings took place in dozens of other cities seeking to include those that geography and economics prevented from attending the major march in DC. Despite what the \u201cthe nattering nabobs of negativity\u201d (to quote Spiro Agnew) portrayed, this was not a crowd of na\u00efve idealists. We were a crowd of very experienced idealists, tired of inaction, propaganda and constitutional misrepresentation aimed at putting the safety of our children and communities behind the paranoid fantasies of the few.

    "title": "West Virginia Mining Disaster\/Which Side Are You On?",
    "album":["Barefoot Boy with Boots On"],
"body": "John: banjo & vocal<br><br>Coal mining is the largest industry in the southwest Virginia area. Most of the songs popularized about coal mining deal with the many dangers inherent to working underground in the often unsafe conditions of the mines. But there's another danger involved\u2014that of staying above ground and waiting for the husbands, fathers, and lovers who risk their lives each day. Here are two songs written from a woman's perspective.<br><br>The first is a powerful reflection on the possibilities of that dread moment. Jean Ritchie, originally from the coal community of Viper, in Perry County, Ky., is one of my very favorite songwriters. Her more well known songs of the coal mining industry include \u201cBlack Waters\u201d and \u201cThe L & N Don't Stop Here Anymore.\u201d<br><br>When the National Miner's Union first started organizing in east Kentucky in the early part of this century, Florence and Sam Reece were two of the early organizers. Part of the idea behind the NMU was that the wives and children of the miners were part of the union as well as the men, for mining touched every member of the family. Florence wrote these new words to the tune \u201cLay the Lilies Low\u201d following a raid on the Reece home by the hired gun thugs of John Henry Blair, high sheriff of Harlan County, Ky. Additional words are from picket lines of the Brookside strike (subject of the film Harlan County, USA) and Sterns, Ky.<br><br>Say, did you see him walking<br>It was early this morning<br>He passed by your houses<br>On his way to the coal<br><br>He was tall, he was slender<br>And his young eyes so tender<br>His occupation was mining<br>West Virginia his home<br><br>It was just before twelve<br>I was feeding the children<br>Ben Mosley come running<br>For to bring us the news<br><br>\u201cNumber 8 is all flooded<br>\u201cMany men are in danger<br>\u201cAnd we don't know their number<br>\u201cBut we fear they're all doomed.\u201d<br><br>So I picked up the baby<br>And I left all the others<br>For to comfort each other<br>And to care for their own<br><br>There's Timmy fourteen<br>And there's John not much younger<br>Soon their own time will be coming<br>To go down the black hole<br><br>Oh, if I had the money<br>To do more than just feed them<br>I'd give them good learnin'<br>The best could be found<br><br>So that when they grew up<br>They'd be checkers and weighers<br>And not spend their life a-drillin'<br>In the dark underground<br><br>What will I tell to my<br>Three little babies?<br>And it's what will I tell<br>His dear mother at home?<br><br>And it's what will I tell<br>My heart that's sure dying?<br>My heart that's sure dying<br>Since my darling is gone?<br><br>***<br><br>Come all of you good workers<br>Good news to you I'll tell<br>Of how the good old union <br>Has come in here to dwell<br><br>Chorus<br><br>Which side are you on?<br>Which side are on?<br>Which side are you on?<br>Tell me, which side are on?<br><br>They say in Harlan County<br>There are no neutrals there <br>You'll be either a union man<br>Or a thug for JH Blair Chorus<br><br>My daddy was a miner<br>And I'm a miner's son<br>And I'll stick with the union<br>Until every battle's won Chorus<br><br>My daddy was a miner<br>And I'm a miner's daughter<br>And I'll stick with the union<br>Through hell and high water Chorus<br><br>We're fighting for a contract<br>We're fighting to be free<br>I'll see you at the picket line<br>There's room for you and me Chorus<br><br>If you don't want to lose your life<br>Down in the old coal mine<br>I'll see you in the morning<br>Down at the picket line Chorus<br><br>Don't scab for the bosses<br>Don't listen to their lies<br>Us poor folks haven't got a chance<br>Unless we organize Chorus<br>"

Being as we were about 8 1\/2 months pregnant over at our house I tried to beg off, but, on my wife, Parthy's insistence, we drove over the mountain for the concert that evening. Well, they had the sound cranked up just a little too high for the first number and Willie, sitting in the front row on the inside of his mother's lap, got the loudest shot of his father's fiddling he'd ever gotten. He immediately started to dance...and didn't stop for the next two hours. Si loved it.<br><br>A week or so after Willie's birth he got his first piece of mail. It was from Si: a wonderful little box.
